Overview 

A Text Editor using Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) efficiently manages text operations such as inserting, deleting, undoing, and redoing user actions. In this implementation, stacks are used to store previous states of the text, enabling quick undo and redo operations by pushing and popping text snapshots. The cursor helps track the current editing position, and operations like insertion or deletion update the text dynamically. By using stacks and string manipulation, the editor ensures smooth text editing while demonstrating how fundamental DSA concepts can be applied to real-world applications.
